## UCL Hacking Seminars

### Every Wednesday, 1-3 pm at UCL Computer Science, 66-72 Gower Street, G01 

This is an extracurricular activity planned for the MSc Information Security students. We open these sessions to voluntary participation by anyone at UCL, including BSc/MEng students. While we aim to bring some industry representatives from time to time to present at these sessions, this is recommended as a student-led activity, and we highly encourage students to volunteer and learn from each other.
